## Purpose
I built this daily planner to create a schedule.
I tried to make it as user friendly as possible. I went ahead an put the date and time up top. And the planner is divided into hours. The hour block change colors depending on if the time is in the past future or present. When the user clicks a time block they can write any notes they have and once they click the save button they can refresh the page and everything gets saved in there.
